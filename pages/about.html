            research, and proven financial principles. We don't chase fads or
            promote get-rich-quick schemes.

            We explain complex financial concepts in simple terms, providing

          <h2>Why Financial Education Matters</h2>

          <p>
            Financial literacy is one of the most important skills you can
            develop, yet it's not taught in most schools. Consider these
            statistics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Only 64% of Americans are financially literate</li>
            <li>The average American has less than $1,000 in savings</li>
            <li>40% couldn't cover a $400 emergency expense</li>
            <li>
              Many people work their entire lives without building significant
              wealth
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These problems aren't due to lack of income—they're due to lack of
            financial education. With the right knowledge and consistent
            application, anyone can improve their financial situation.

              <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> The Power of Compound Interest
            </h4>
            <p>
              Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth
              wonder of the world." Starting early and staying consistent with
              your savings and investments can create life-changing wealth over
              time.
